Hi, I'm **Guixian Zhang**, currently a second year PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence (Computer Science and Technology) at China University of Mining and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Guan Yuan](http://faculty.cumt.edu.cn/yuanguan/zh_CN/index.htm). Before that, I was pursuing my master's degree at Guangxi Normal University under the supervision of Prof. [Shichao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl&user=heE6vKAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). My current research interest includes Graph Neural Network, Trustworthy AI, Causality, and AI4S. I have published 10+ papers with total [70+ google scholar citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u81-9zQAAAAJ&hl). Meanwhile, I'm extra focused on AI applications in social networks, physics and biomedicine. I am also hobbyist in photography, cookery and football.
